# FlashCardProject

Description:

The French-English Flashcards project is a Python application designed to assist users in learning and practicing French vocabulary and its corresponding English translations. It presents users with random French words and, after a brief delay, reveals the English translation. Users can then indicate whether they know the translation by clicking a tick (checkmark) or an "x" (cross) box. This interactive learning approach helps reinforce language skills and expand vocabulary.

Features:

Randomized Flashcards: The app displays a random French word from a predefined list, ensuring varied vocabulary exposure.

Translation Reveal: After a few seconds, the app reveals the English translation of the displayed word.

User Feedback: Users can click a tick box if they know the translation or an "x" box if they don't, allowing for self-assessment.

Dependencies:

Python 3.11

Tkinter (for the graphical user interface)
